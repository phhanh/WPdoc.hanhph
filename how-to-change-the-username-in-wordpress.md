**Changing the username** is used to be difficult for people as it is the unique identity for each user. However, things are now totally possible for WordPress users. 

Username is the identification that is used by a person in order to access to a computer, network or online service. This is how the computer, online network recognise and locate you, and also connect you to other users as well. Which is why people are allowed to have one username only without any changing. If they want to have their username reformed, they are compelled to sign up for a new account with a different email address. Otherwise, they can change their display name (nickname) which is the one to be seen on the top of your page, posts or comments, instead of username.

Thankfully, WordPress users now feel free and satisfied with that this website lets its users alter not only display name but also their account username. Username normally is changed adapting user’s demand, as that person find it not suitable for them at that moment. Therefore, this permission is really helped. Nevertheless, remember that once you have your username changed, there will not be a way back. The old name will no longer be available for you and anyone else to use and you are not able to get a new different one as well. Unless it is necessary for you to have a new username, take under consideration about rename your display name temporarily only.

In today’s topic, you will be directed **how to have your username renamed in WordPress**.

(Illustrate that  your new username is newusername, your blog’s address will be transferred to newusername.wordpress.com. And you cannot use the old address again.)
- Choosing *“Yes, change example.wordpress.com to match my new username and create an empty blog with the old address”* will change the address of your current blog (illustrate that your new username is newusername, your blog’s address will be transferred to newusername.wordpress.com), and create a bare blog at your former blog address.
2. Choosing *“Yes, create a new blog to match my new username”* will create a new blog for you. Illustrate that  your new username is newusername, the new blog will be newusername.wordpress.com
3. Choosing *“No, don’t create a matching address”* will change your username only without making any changes to your blog address.
